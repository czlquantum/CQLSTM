don 't care about sunlight : it 's tft .	1
after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem .	0
it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there .	1
it is currently permanently mounted ( 3 years now ) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot .	1
sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much .	0
with the automatic settings , i really have n 't taken a bad picture yet .	1
and , with the ipods ' full volume up , all you have to do is adjust your receivers ' volume and your set , since the ipod itself acts as a strong amp lifer of its ' own .	1
you also need to go in and manually remove many symantec files from the registry .	0
i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .	1
i got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags .	1
dependability : i 've seen no glitches .	1
i 'd say that this camera is perfect .	1
- very long-lasting battery life	1
even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little , resulting in a noisy start-up .	0
another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .	1
wo n 't play a lot of discs .	0
you need the software to actually transfer files	0
when taking pictures of people , however , it shows every flaw in the subject 's skin .	0
features : really , there aren 't any features , unless you call the games a feature .	0
best phone i 've ever owned , period .	1
but this does work even if you turn off the lcd viewing -- great battery saver .	1
no line out jack - as i said , there is none .	0
with the plunge lift all my bit changing has been done above the table , although i still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock ( and , of course , the speed and on/off controls ) .	0
this player is fantastic in terms of audio quality , ease of use , and features .	1
it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it .	0
. this camera keeps on outfoxing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped .	0
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial . its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n 't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )	0
this player is an ideal purchase .	1
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .	1
after two weeks the picture kept freezing .	0
sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches .	0
the movie mode is also working great .	1
the battery life seems good , takes very little time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs .	1
3 . the nokia 6600 has a brilliant java interface .	1
even did while daughter sleep and no noise ! .	1
for the zen creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out , well presented and easy to open and put back together .	1
when the overall image quality ( especially natural colours , details , natural looking of the pictures ) is the most important thing , then this camera its top notch and very impressive .	1
i upgraded from an older 801 . 11b router to the linksys wrt54g for its improved security , and of course , speed .	1
i 've had nothing but good luck with t-mobile .	1
why bother when it works perfectly with media player 10 ? .	1
however since this router is backward compatible , that doesn 't pose a problem at all .	1
after research of other creative hard drive players , i found that most of them aren 't very durable and tend to crash ( read most reviews on amazon . com and see for yourself ) .	0
overall , a very disappointing product .	0
what makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has .	1
i use it on a router table , and it is works well .	1
the manual is excellent .	1
the zen does n 't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; . even with third party software that `` creates `` folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .	0
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket .	0
i love the touchpaper controls .	1
after a week i tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn 't do anything but turn on my player .	0
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable ! .	1
five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums .	1
the camera has a wonderful set of features .	1
getting files onto it is quick and painless .	1
the micro seemed like an ipod for less .	1
then when i went to norton 's website to obtain a priority id number per the instructions i had been given , i couldn 't find a way to get one .	0
essentially , the cd included with the package is , for the most part , worthless .	0
i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .	1
remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons .	0
it is a bit difficult to get the unit open ( the advice to take it slowly is sound ) , but now that our son is walking and exploring , i consider this a positive attribute ! .	1
the song quality of the ipod is excellent , and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory , for most users .	1
this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; . and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .	0
additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screen saver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc . )	1
a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop	0
and , when you think about it , it 's insulting that norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase , whether on the phone or online ( what if your computer is down ? . ) , should have equal priority .	0
the image quality is excellent .	1
the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .	0
i give it 4-stars only because the installation process - or rather problems that may surface during the installation process - can be frustrating to the average computer user .	0
their customer ( www . apex digital inc . com ) service is very poor .	0
the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .	1
i 've searched the program and their online tech support ( worthless ) and have found no solutions .	0
while i am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time , my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem much better than linksys .	1
the cons are n 't really a big deal to me . . . except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files . . . no folder structure . . . and it 's based on the title of the songs . . . many of my songs where separated into folders ( on the pc ) . . . and a few had same titles . . . so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n 't have any that might be the same as another .	0
capacity is not a problem here .	1
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .	0
the software has n 't been a hassle for me at all .	1
not so nice things : - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing ( outside of a table ) - the 1/4 `` chuck sleeve requires much tightening to keep bits from slipping	0
only con i can think of is no camera . . . .	0
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .	1
i have not been disappointed with my purchase .	1
turn the camera on while pressing the button ( or is it the menu button ? . i have to check again = ) ) and it 'l show you the time and date .	1
i think it 's great .	1
sharper pictures .	1
very cool features . . . great camera with zoom . . . cool quality pictures . . . great ringtones . . . bluetooth feature is great . . . .	1
i even downloaded the product 's user manual - useless .	0
picture quality 's great for still and video with sound .	1
- outstanding signal reception	1
with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .	1
so , right out of the box i had issue .	0
personally , i am very pleased with the diaper champ .	1
i also had no problems installing or running the camera software on my pc .	1
this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone .	1
the controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use .	1
this one is really great .	1
hate to wait between shots	1
the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .	1
i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .	1
in fact , it supports the new wpa encryption standard , which is way better than wep .	1
it is an extremely cool cozmo .	1
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .	0
i tried to call norton , and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for non-tech customer service ( tried this one and hung up after 75 minute of muzak ) or they have a $ 30 tech-support number .	0
after @ 3 months , it stopped playing higher number scenes on dvds .	0
the fm tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake .	1
i was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work , to no avail .	0
navigation could be better , but there is n 't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .	0
since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work `` in 24 hours `` .	0
i also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my aux slot in the store 's sound system .	1
i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .	1
after using it for just a month , i could not play any dvd .	0
i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes ! .	0
the downside being that the tito can only connect at 802 . 11b speeds and not 802 . 11g .	0
great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! . ! . ! .	1
i then realized a major design flaw .	0
overall it is a great value .	1
i 've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and i truely love it .	1
so far it has been very durable ( other than the little pads on the earbuds ) , but those aren 't really necessary as i find them comfortable on their own .	1
the power is incredible , it cut through md and plywood like butter .	1
3 . the remote capture and file viewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .	1
+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit	1
enjoy .	1
3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .	0
battery non-issue .	1
what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .	0
the general button placement is not very user friendly .	0
i , as many others , have waited for many years for the convergence of price , features , size and ease of use to hit that happy center point .	1
i 've yet to find the limitation for this hitachi ( my only hitachi tool , by the way ) and quite frankly , i don 't know that i have the muscle to push this machine any harder .	1
i did notice if you turn the phone on and off the os takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker .	1
great product , easy to use , economical , effective , absolutly fabulous .	1
the product i rate five stars ,	1
4 ) buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging .	0
my main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn 't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag .	0
loved the slim design .	1
* eax equalizer accentuates diminished quality of mp3 files .	0
the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with `` canned air . ``	0
absolutely no problems with this router .	1
a call to customer support ( got to a live person within a couple of minutes ) helped me tweak a couple of the settings to streamline performance .	1
you can `` disable `` some of the individual components , but don 't be fooled -- they 're still there and running .	0
while they all seem to have their own positives and negatives , i picked the zen micro over the ipod mini , because i am not an apple person , never has been - i wanted something that is fully compatible with windows media player .	1
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .	1
it takes great pictures .	1
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house , that one didn `` t work either ! .	0
i 'm really happy with this purchase .	1
the ms scandisk would appear due to manual shutdown and would only scan to the 2nd bar , over and over ( up to 1 hr , i then shut it down and used go back ) .	0
the new drivers on cannon 's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software .	0
software downloads on the site crashed my pc .	0
all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .	1
the white-led backlit lcd is very bright and crisp , even in sunlight , and relatively easy on the battery .	1
it 's too bad , though , that ! .	0
i will say that the os that the phone runs does have a few issues .	0
we use regular kitchen sized garbage bags .	1
short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .	0
after telling the rep and his tech supervisor the problem the only answer was to uninstall the program ( which i had already done ) . . .	0
at any rate , if you have been interested in digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back , consider the canon s100 digital elph .	1
for my first i had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky .	0
they fix the problem and help you with whatever your i-pod needs comes with two usb ports and a charger .	1
while this phone obviously doesn 't have the same quality construction as motorola does , the nokia 6600 is one of the better phones i 've used .	1
- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .	0
if you want to work wirelessly , this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now .	1
to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .	0
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice verse ) was easy too .	1
great picture quality - in automatic mode , quality is great .	1
i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures .	1
i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .	0
the program is fully featured , with much of what you 'd want from a security program --	1
customer service : awful . listen to this one , remember the battery statement i made earlier .	0
the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an `` auto `` mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .	1
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it .	1
this thing plays everything i feed it .	1
i already knew something was wrong , because much of the spam i 've seen in the past six months was from resellers of norton products .	0
when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n 't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked .	0
also , diapers tend to stay in the middle , causing the pail to get backed up .	0
- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price	1
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .	1
the songs do n 't play one after another like on a cd .	0
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .	1
the touch pad does take a little getting used to .	0
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .	1
i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .	1
pros the design is very nice , and the colors are too .	1
value : comparing data storage with price .	1
the picture quality of this camera is outstanding ( taking its ' size and price into consideration ) .	1
but , the creative zen micro is plagued by a serious , serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw , and i 'm going to tell you what it is . . . but first , two more things about this piece of garbage that 's so great and could 've made it a potential ipod killer .	0
i have no complaints with this mp3 player .	1
second might be a problem i might have with my pc but not too sure , when the player is connected on the usb and i start playing on it and also using the windows explorer , it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronize with the pc during play , which is a bit irritating .	0
i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift .	1
and the video quality is amazing .	1
this is overall the best point and shoot camera i 've used .	1
it took several days of attempts before things finally `` worked `` again and i have n 't a clue why .	0
one drop from a pocket or desktop , and it 'd be a goner .	0
friends told me that the diaper genie did not work very well , so bought the diaper champ based on on-line reviews and i have been happy with it .	1
the sound is very nice .	1
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .	1
linksys is more costlier than others and is a home/consumer division of disco .	0
while i was trying to play half life 2 it started popping up with `` alerts `` every twenty seconds ( literally ) , warning me my antivirus protection was off .	0
oh . . . and file transfers are fast & easy .	1
it wouldn 't always work seamlessly with wmp and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it .	0
start up , log off , log on . . . everything became very slow .	0
so far it all works fine with either cable or wireless connections .	1
all you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network .	1
the instant setup button in the front of the router messes up the network it is better to configure the router manually .	0
the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .	1
other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2 . 5 mm headset jack .	0
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .	1
output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv .	1
like most of their solutions ( which first blame other applications for errors ) , the tech persons line was that this was probably a microsoft error - it was not .	0
fm receiver - it has none .	0
everything , so far , has worked flawlessly .	1
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sis , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings .	0
the fact that has an open-source firmware makes it a great option in my opinion .	1
it has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight .	1
ball metaphor : i was hoping creative hit a home run here , and i think the zen micro is more like a stand-up double .	1
im able to keep my phone on for about a week ( mostly stand by ) to three days ( regular use )	1
we really enjoyed shooting with the canon powershot sd500 .	1
the scroll wheel is finicky ; . it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; . new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; . some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .	0
the only thing i don 't like about it is that you have to buy a larger memory card , first thing ! .	0
because the `` engineers `` at creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack .	0
the quality is significant and you 'll be very happy from saving time and the headache .	1
the player kept displaying `` no disc `` , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ # * ! .	0
i did n 't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out .	0
i am enjoying my phone a lot . . . .	1
you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .	1
creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices .	1
the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .	1
only thing i don 't like about it is slow in changing apps , boot up , and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth .	0
anted to rate the router higher than 1 star , due to its security , easy of use , etc .	1
only 1 problem , no accessories . . . yet .	0
i had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed ( mainly the slow processor ) , and then i couldn 't get the damn thing off my computer completely ! .	0
this camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation .	1
we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work `` apex `` dvd players and none worked .	0
right out of the box , i loved it , better features than the ipod , great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources i can use .	1
i can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images , calender events , contacts and anything else .	1
with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ; .	1
the buttons are rather stiff .	0
it holds a lot of diapers , not to mention the odor ! .	1
they obviously have quality and reliability problems .	0
i don 't know if we 'll run into trouble down the road with odors , but so far i have no complaints and i 'm very happy not to have to buy those refills .	1
you need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network .	1
do n 't buy this player .	0
service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .	1
i dont use the belt clip cz it fails to hold the player securely ( design problem ) .	0
i occasionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly ( yes i have it in maximum desensitized mode ) .	0
this is the best phone i have seen .	1
i did see the review here and other places about a cracked lcd screen .	0
much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n 't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate	1
the 4g ipod costs the same as this 5g zen micro .	1
the diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into `` what diaper smell `` in less time than that .	1
if you 'll only read the whole manual , you 'll find out even more cool features and you 'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading	1
8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows media player , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cb service ( gracenotes ) .	1
sometimes , various applications crash .	0
so , you might inquire , why don 't they make it a first priority to carefully , simply explain how download music from your music library to their device ? . ? . ? . this seems academic to me .	0
it 's easy to use . not too small , and not too big .	1
i have been absolutely , completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities .	1
its just as fast as the included creative software , but much less invasive , and overall better looking .	1
operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie levitt 's , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .	1
however , this product performed well below my expectation .	0
if the plunging action is critical to your work , look elsewhere .	0
it was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers .	0
it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy .	1
the controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed	1
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .	1
with bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long .	1
they are sensitive and accurate ( perhaps too accurate , it senses through t-shirt cloth , but the touchpad can be locked ) , but easy to clean , unlike buttons .	1
we keep the diaper champ in our daughter 's nursery and her room definitely does not smell like dirty diapers .	1
it was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers .	1
great phone , i 'd buy another .	1
what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .	0
everything that i have listed above , the zen has , and more .	1
all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player .	1
i have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds , no big deal .	1
it was a good player when it worked and i loved the design .	1
the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes ! .	1
bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature . . . but not on this player . . .	0
what i like the most : - small and solid feel .	1
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n 't notice after first day .	0
a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging -- - how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )	1
the camera res ponce is very quick .	1
but those 2 come up every time .	0
i must say , this one is quite slow to open an application .	0
after installation , the very first time i booted up the creative mediasource organizer , intending to use its cd burning and ripping functions , it totally shorted out .	0
anti-spam is good	1
so-so 1 . customer service - 6 calls half were efficient other half were equally incompetent .	0
within one month , my player completely died .	0
the nokia 660 runs the symbian os , which works pretty well for most standard phone fare , most of the stuff is not that intuitive , but if you actually learn how to use it all , there 's plenty of neat tie-ins .	1
4 ) the camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away .	0
now that i have all my music on it there has n 't been any more problems .	1
really like it , easy to use , great images , very intuitive , fits in my jacket pocket .	1
- the battery life leaves a lot to be desired .	0
dont rely on t-mobile rebates .	0
the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .	1
as one other reviewer pointed out , it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the `` plunger `` to get the diapers in the pail , even though upon inspection the bag doesn 't really look full .	0
the volume .	0
controls easy yo use and easy to get to .	1
i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .	0
it is mindless to operate .	1
4 . play n-gage games on it .	1
i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .	1
the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .	1
this player seems to work fine with everything else .	1
maybe this new design is more durable than the last , but i kind of doubt it .	0
the dvd player is fine .	1
on the contrary , i 'm quite pleased with my upgrade .	1
we just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are scented and they are like $ 6 . 00 and they work great .	1
i 'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera .	1
f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the aesthetics bit down , of course	0
the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .	0
now this router is not the cheapest on the market .	0
the battery is also convenient , but could have been better , such as the zen touch 's battery ( but at least this one is removable ) .	1
the software is great .	1
i left the camera in my car in maine ( not a very hot place ) and the lcd screen cracked ! .	0
it 's easy .	1
4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! . )	1
i treat the battery well and it has lasted .	1
and it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old s30 .	1
i find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on .	0
the battery life is amazing .	1
i just uninstalled systemworks and internet security for at least the fifth time due to functionality issues .	0
i love my new nomad , its great ! .	1
the headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of `` ear buds `` .	0
finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .	0
the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .	0
this is a great phone i have this phone since feb 04 and i never have any problem at all .	1
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .	1
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .	1
i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .	0
i enthusiastically recommend this camera .	1
seems to work great .	1
the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .	1
all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .	1
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .	1
the other pail i used started to smell after 2 weeks of use .	0
overall though , i 'm very happy with it and highly recommend it to folks looking for a mp3 player , even if it is to pretend your not a brain dead consumer giving into the marketing hype of the ipod . ; . )	1
once installed , however , some of the functions do work ok ( disk doctor , one button checkup , and win doctor ) .	1
if you currently own the 2003 version , and are looking to upgrade to the 2004 version , don 't .	0
if you think you are saving $ 40 getting the hitachi , you are right , and you are also getting a router worth $ 40 less than a makita .	0
i also love that you can flip the device with one hand . . .	1
the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .	0
for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .	1
i can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than motorola 's do , but as long as i 'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine .	1
after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .	1
audio on video also lacking .	0
- some features in the user interface	0
otherwise , i am extremely please with the creative zen micro 5gb mp3 player .	1
so far i haven 't had so much complaints except that i still haven 't mastered how to scandisk when using internet security .	0
the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .	1
i still can 't believe how fast it starts up .	1
probably a great phone overall , and perhaps mine just has bugs .	1
other plusses : changeable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .	1
7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .	1
it films 10 second video , for crying out loud .	1
the sound is quite good , in terms of volume .	1
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine .	1
i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n 't a big problem .	0
apex does n 't answer the phone .	0
also the battery life isn 't great but it 's sufficient for my needs .	0
give each friend a different ringtone .	1
it holds plenty of songs .	1
it is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some porter cable models i tried .	1
- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .	0
one caveat i have is that i understand the ipod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved .	0
transferring files couldn 't be easier thanks to the included software bundle .	1
the gprs web access is slow ! .	0
3 ) joy stick for eazy navigation , 35mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff .	1
typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others .	0
5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .	0
wish i could give it 4 1/2 stars .	1
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n 't as easy as i would have liked .	0
but it is smooth , it is powerful , it is affordable & it has a proven track record .	1
the bass is deep and the treble is clear .	1
the player itself has all sorts of problems .	0
i tell you now , after lot of shooting in many different situations , this camera is amazing .	1
i was looking for something that wasn 't too complicated to use and to help the pics i post on ebay show more detail .	1
the flaw is inside the zen .	0
so far , the anti-spam feature seems to be very good .	1
there technical service isn 't helpful either ; . they just read what 's on their website and charge you $ 50 ( + toll fees ) to do it .	0
it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .	1
imagine my disappointment , though , when the zen micro proved able to play only the mega-strongest fm signals in my area .	0
it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .	1
amazon is awesome ! .	1
the bottom line is `` phone is cool one - only for the moment , as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features , but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones `` .	1
finding all the albums , songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have 20 gig ( well 18 gig ) worth of music .	1
size - bigger than the ipod	0
the great and versatile ipod	1
powerup is quick , and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on .	1
it 's easy to use ( just a flip of the lid , and the diaper is gone ! . ) .	1
best in class .	1
nokia makes great phones , and this one is the cream of the crop .	1
the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .	1
the setup and transfer process was cake for me .	1
the software that comes with the digital elph is very nice and intuitive .	1
overall it is the best camera on the market .	1
the phone offers a 32 mb mmc card and i think that is certainly the most exciting feature .	1
i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .	1
it is buggy , slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user .	0
i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .	1
hitachi 's m12v is a big beast of a router .	1
can 't say whether i rec 'd an `` updated `` model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me .	0
it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .	1
the g3 looks like a work of art ! .	1
you must keep double checking depths .	0
controls are a bit awkward .	0
yin to point out they have experience , and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best .	1
it constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like walls in our house block the link so everything is very slow .	0
i did it and it was worse the second time around . . . unbelievable .	0
the in ital setup of the router was simple .	1
the included earphones are pretty good - my advice ? .	1
if you need a wireless router . . . . get it get it get it . . . . works really good . . . .	1
now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it ! .	1
whatever . . . on to the negatives : -touchy about charging . . . you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it 's life if you don 't upgrade the firmware or dont ' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side .	0
the grain was terrible .	0
glad to see the ed . revised the previous statements regarding image quality .	1
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the `` rigor `` of a business traveler .	0
sometimes , it needs few minutes to open an application .	0
i read many reviews on norton i . s . 2004 from a variety of sources ( cnet , amazon , message boards ) and came to the conclusion that nis 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update .	0
there is also a small covering for the lens , so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched .	1
a very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years .	1
after repeal cleaning and re cleaning , it still stuck after using it for a little while .	0
they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality .	1
2- excellent picture quality and so simple to use ! . ! . ! .	1
nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have .	1
everything else about the ipod is great , the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it .	1
last , i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this .	0
very good `` every day `` camera . fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos .	1
11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player	1
do not buy any home version of norton anything .	0
. itunes -- this is a love-hate relationship program ; . usually people with mac like this program than people with a pc , but depending on your computer expertise , this could be a difficult program to use , and it is required for an ipod .	1
difficult navigation - i wo n 't necessarily say `` difficult , `` but i do n 't enjoy the scroll wheel to navigate .	0
the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .	1
great camera .	1
battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargeable , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .	1
the software sucks .	0
this camera is great if you 're used to a high-end slr .	1
i have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it .	1
i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered .	0
this process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway .	0
all in all , this is a great phone .	1
the first one would n 't work from the start .	0
it is without even a slight doubt , my new favorite .	1
i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .	1
i found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus , manual mode , iso 100 ( shorter aperture-time , so more often sharper images as with iso 50 ) , auto white balance ( auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras i have and they already do very-well ) .	1
i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus .	1
but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .	1
at first i had a problem with some smell , then i realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all ! .	1
the battery life is less than stellar , but it charges w/ the quickness .	1
recently the variable speed control went out .	0
its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge ( not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips ) .	0
was a bit wary because the software is windows only and i have an mac .	0
i use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags i already use in the kitchen for it -- no special `` diaper `` trash bags necessary .	1
it is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags , easy to clean , and most important , easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle .	1
i love that you don 't have to purchase expensive refills .	1
also , the instruction manual is very bad .	0
the m12v has been great .	1
also , for those that complain that the diaper champ isn 't as effective as time passes , keep the following in mind : as babies get older , their diets changes ( aka solid foods ! . ) and so does the smell of their diapers ! .	0
i 'm in high school , and this camera is perfect for what i use it for , carrying it around in my pocket so i can take pictures whenever i want to , of my friends and of funny things that happen .	1
having done all this , i was quite pleased to see that all corners i needed were decently covered by the signal .	1
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use .	1
the interface has a sassier flair and the blue-lit trimming is an added bonus .	1
i 've had this player for more than 4 months and i 'm very happy with it .	1
ability to play most discs - i tried dvd , vcd , dvd-r , audio cd and it played all	1
the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .	1
the included memory card is too small .	0
i have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode , while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera , its quality easily surpasses that of my old hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe ( max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card ) .	1
there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful .	1
perfect size ! . beats the competition by leaps and bounds .	1
even after all the nightmare sound problems , i 'd still half-way like this product if it kept it 's promise ; . the ability to store 1500 songs .	0
contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .	1
some adjustments in the settings could help make it better .	0
the camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great ( not as good as prints from my pro digital camera , but still very good ) .	1
almost from the beginning , liveupdate would not function .	0
initially , i was very impressed , after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this , i then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright .	1
overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .	1
they last about 1 1/2 years until the problems start .	0
2 . the scroll button is n 't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .	0
awesome for the newbie , though i personally like to fasten every bolt myself .	1
it works great , i am usually at the full 54 mbps , although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is .	1
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ) .	0
the camera is as easy to use as a point and shoot , and with instant review on the lcd screen , you can retake any flubbed shots on the spot .	1
don 't buy the diaper champ .	0
it is a multifunction phone , reception quality is better than the 610 .	1
i 've had it for about a week now and have to say it 's one of the best purchases i 've ever made .	1
nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .	1
only used for 3 month before it 's down ! .	0
fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the met 60 ct-4 .	1
- large easy readable screen	1
) worst feature possible , this alone makes it rate one star : what 's up with no recharge cord ? .	0
have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility .	1
the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good .	1
3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players	0
canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .	1
4 . the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) .	0
i absolutely love it .	1
the size of the camera is perfect .	1
there seem to be fewer collisions and dropped packets as i read from the router logs than with my old dlink router .	1
i love the storage in this thing .	1
you don 't need to cough up an extra couple bucks for a `` special edition `` to get black ! . - sound : awesome ! . - batteries : removable/replaceable .	1
the touch controls took a little getting used to but now i wouldn 't change it for the scroll wheel .	0
i actually purchased two phones recently ( this one at the new blackberry phone ) , and this one is far superior ( imho ) .	1
clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people ! . ! . ! .	1
software - the software is crap .	0
you have to wonder why creative can 't get this right .	0
it seems like the software is just not responding .	0
i 've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures .	1
i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ; .	1
with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .	1
handsfree future is good , but not too exciting .	1
learning how to use it will not take very long .	1
the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n 't come in the overused blue .	0
i find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much .	0
sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization .	1
the heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything i threw at it .	1
the subscription files are still a little slower to transfer , but it 's only by about 10 % or so .	0
all in all , this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price .	1
for the price i think this is a remarkably fun mp3 player .	1
it just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre-existing router ( mine does ) , without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard-wired pc or a wireless equipped pc .	0
*	0
it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .	1
the fine adjustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table .	0
although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .	1
well , i have an ipod mini - and i really like it , but all in all , i like the zen micro more .	1
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .	1
after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it .	0
i 've had no problems with the software .	1
i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it ! .	1
also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 `` tv ) .	0
in addition , i do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours , and it can take four hours for a full charge .	0
even on the low sensitive level , a slight touch can skip or pause the track .	0
this camera is so light and tiny that i literally carry it everywhere with me , which is great considering i 'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting .	1
no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .	1
because of this , i am disappointed and would not recommend this product .	0
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used .	1
the radio and voice recording are nice .	1
the battery life is not that of the casio 's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opinion with the battery life you 've got .	1
the voice recorders good , but you can 't record songs off the radio for ring tones .	1
headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature .	0
5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .	1
it does n 't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive .	1
my old siemens s56 , on the other hand , worked beautifully with all of the above .	0
it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar .	1
but now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using freshener .	0
the touch-pad would be a great thing if it worked well , and as i never had issues getting songs transferred to the player , i did have problems accessing them from the player .	0
what an upgrade ! . ! . ! .	1
it feels tiny in the hand without it .	1
as i drove across the country i lost reception only in eastern kentucky 's mountains .	1
i use it in the table ( never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob ) , in my woo drat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances .	1
i 'm currently using a sony vaio s-150 ( which i bought at the end of this past august ) , and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system - in fact , i 've taken to just hibernating , rather than shutting down completely .	0
the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .	1
it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .	1
all the `` cool `` features of the mini , but with 20gb instead of 5 .	1
00 % good though , and the zen does have a few drawbacks .	0
warning ! . the windows `` remove program `` feature does not do a good job of this , and neither does norton 's own removal program .	0
the volume level of the phone is not all that good .	0
the diaper champ is the best we found ! .	1
it also holds a lot more diapers .	1
fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket .	1
it has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside .	1
for the price , it 's a very nice dvd player .	1
just the home version of norton internet/av has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with .	0
but , all of this means nothing , because of the serious , serious , stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw : after 3 months , give or take a few weeks , you won 't be able to hear anything .	0
it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .	0
and really this is the best phone one could have .	1
accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .	1
when i purchase software , i never want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry ! .	0
songs transfer lightning fast , and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time .	1
i could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point , but this pr duct seems to work very well so far .	1
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .	0
i took it out one day and the lcd was not working .	0
nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .	1
so far i have no complaints with this player .	1
but the earbuds suck ! .	0
it looks great - and is loaded with features .	1
6600 looks and feels nice .	1
when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture ! .	0
the software was great , as long as you have an administrative user account ( windows xp ) .	1
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .	1
i got about 700 loaded up before it told me i was full , and at that point , i was ready to toss it out the window .	0
you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .	1
first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .	0
their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific .	1
so reliability is the winner here for the ipod .	1
the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .	0
( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n 't play and they were new ones ! .	0
this doesn 't affect standard mp3 files - just subscription wma files .	0
- equipment included is average , but that is n 't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .	1
1 . pictures wo n 't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .	0
this product is amazing and better than the ipod you can get at the same price .	1
on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .	0
the extra gb is just a bonus .	1
the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .	1
all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n 't done it since .	0
the sound quality is also nice . . . after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with .	1
overall , this product is awesome .	1
also , the fit and finish could be better although this doesn 't detract from performance .	0
solid food poop is very stinky and this diaper pail doesn 't really contain the smell .	0
when you learn how to change some settings , you can make the quality even better	1
surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available .	1
all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved .	1
i had tried to uninstall norton internet security a few weeks ago , and it wouldn 't let me do that either .	0
i give this product five stars for its usability , performance , expandability , and definitely looks ! .	1
the auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject .	0
but for what i do use it is perfect .	1
the movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160x120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640x480 .	0
i did n 't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase ! .	1
transfering mp3s are a cinch with the included software .	1
however after just one month my headphone jack was broken as a result of normal , every-day use .	0
if you 've been listening to cd 's in your car for awhile , dealing with the drop-off in sound quality may take some getting used to .	0
i 've read about the issues with the scroll bar , but they must have taken care of that now .	0
the total price with delivery ( free shipping ) was $ 135 ! .	1
they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy .	0
1 no direct firewire to the camera .	0
i don 't know what 's happened to norton , but 2004 is absolute garbage .	0
this is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers .	1
i am glad that i do not work for norton .	0
the battery recharges raul fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .	1
i have a hard time using other phones with smaller screens ! . ! . ! .	1
who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a `` foreign `` computer just to move over some simple ( * . txt ) files ? .	0
there was neither picture nor sound .	0
i bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it , or have already bought it -- it 's size .	1
i don 't believe this camera is still available . but if you can find one , you might like to get it .	1
* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ) .	0
sound quality is great , fm tuner is fine , as is the recorder .	1
easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot .	1
in addition it is very easy to setup .	1
i 'd recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop , but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until linksys improves their desktop software/hardware .	0
the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .	1
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n 't play all my dvds , and now the player can 't play everything .	0
there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .	1
1 speakers at home , i rarely use it with the earbuds , though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players .	1
it 's faster than wmp .	1
this is a great diaper pail .	1
remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s .	1
however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .	1
the view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer .	1
after comparing the included creative earbuds directly against my sony md-e828lp 's and sennheiser mx-400 's , i find myself still using the creative 's , which in my opinion , sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord .	1
the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; . see below ) .	1
all at the same time , and all without a hitch .	1
huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .	1
i love the performance and features of this router .	1
nice things about the m12v : - in a table , the powerful 3 1/4 hp motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - amazon 's price	1
the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better .	1
pc cable is too expensive . . . $ 50 for a usb cable ? .	0
initially these phones were fun to play with some of the cool features like the speaker phone , web browser and of course the built in camera .	1
the 6600 ( t-mobile ) is the true 'world phone ' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe , including new zealand and australia ( 900 ) whereas the 6620 ( available from singular ) replaces it w/ 800mhz ( some refer to as 850 ) .	1
creative was defiantly giving the ipod a run for their money with this device .	1
before you run out and buy an ipod , understand something : there are reasons the zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle , principally excellent ( for mp3 ) sound quality .	1
got a `` system error `` problem 30 days after purchase .	0
i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product .	1
i built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits .	0
i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .	0
just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc .	1
this product is a lifesaver ! . ! .	1
i imagine if i left my player untouched ( no backlight ) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level .	1
despite a critical start , this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do ( which is pretty lofty ) . . . does more than most . . . does it well . . . is dependable .	1
it is a very amazing product .	1
mine was so bad i had to to use a hammer to free it ( and this is why i 'm giving it 4 , not 5 stars ) .	0
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing .	0
what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .	1
and , other else , the camera is still vga .	0
your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package .	1
the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .	1
the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .	1
still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper ! .	1
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera . .	1
i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch wide screen dvd 's to normal .	1
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want .	0
the battery life last es 12 hours , and charges quickly . ( as mentioned above , the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all ! . ) once you 've downloaded your music , you can access the tracks by artist , genre , album , composer ( this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e . g . covers of songs ) , etc .	1
it locked during install and i had to reformat the drive and start from scratch ( greer ! . )	0
the price compared to the ipod is great .	1
the accessories that come with the player are great .	1
it 's easy and really works , with some incredible range .	1
one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it .	1
also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4 . 99 / mo . ) never works .	0
creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature . .	1
i did n 't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .	1
the software failed repeatedly .	0
the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line .	0
downside : it takes a long time to start up .	0
this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks . . .	0
4- my idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone ex cells at nothing , less than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the `` other than phone `` functionalists , you 'll be disappointed . . . . if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine . . . . but don 't expect to get much done .	0
it has given me zero problems , and the more i use it , the better i become at taking advantage of its strengths .	1
at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast ! .	1
ripping the songs , even with my 1 . 1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .	1
the sound is incredible ; . very clean , very wide dynamic range of bass , midas and highs , and can be very loud if i turn it up full blast .	1
second , the setup cd actually worked perfectly .	1
this camera has a major design flaw .	0
whichever it may be , i 'm happy i 've made this purchase .	1
i 'd give it 4 . 5 stars if possible , but since 5 stars would be misleading , i give it 4 stars .	1
4 ) the viewfinder is bordered lcd skying .	0
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :	1
this is my first mp3 player and i am so impressed with what such a small device can do .	1
sound : this is where i love zen the most .	1
from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic meg atones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .	1
holy cow ! . it really does scratch easily ! .	0
now in october , 2004 , the firewall said i couldn 't ok anymore software to use the internet because its full .	0
the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .	1
i couldn 't get the install wizard to work .	0
if you want to purchase a real case or container or clip-on carrier for you zen micro , expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time . .	0
i tried it again this morning and it said i didn 't have the required `` permissions `` and lacked proper administrator status .	0
i feel much less likely to drop this phone than others , which are actually starting to get too small .	1
i 've owned many norton products in my time , and for the most part , i 've been pleased with their performance .	1
flawless .	1
price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .	1
the problems i had installing norton extended way beyond what symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with .	0
but at least you re starting with the most photo realistic images ive ever seen from a camera .	1
i recently bought the linksys wrt54g router and have been very happy with the router itself .	1
output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold .	0
the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily .	1
namely , it wouldnt sync .	0
i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .	1
sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .	1
the back of the ipod is in a chrome finish , and this surface is prone to scratches .	0
wow - was that disappointing and we didn 't even have it 6 months before it broke .	1
as far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price- remember this router is the same one that was released right when the g standard was introduced to the market .	1
stay away from this junk .	0
simple to use and hook up .	1
i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far .	1
only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash .	0
4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .	0
i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him .	1
i have owned this camera for a short time and would n 't give it up for anything .	1
i didn 't have any major problems installing this software .	1
this player is absolutely phenomenal , i haven 't had any problems , and if you 're worried you will have problems , i suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways . . . i find the touch pad very easy to use , and i 'm surprised so many people have had problems .	1
it has a handsfree loudspeaker , conference and transfer ! .	1
no smell , easy to use with one hand free , and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you don 't get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are impossible to find ! .	1
once a depth is locked , it will jump off a little while working .	0
i 've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far , and i 've not to get either product working properly .	0
while it didn 't have all the features i would have liked , it was better than anything else i could find at the time .	1
with the right firmware , drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive .	1
the sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn 't be easier to use .	1
you can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player .	1
i could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days ! .	0
record memos using the built in microphone .	1
so now it still plays everything , you just can 't see it ! .	0
the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n 't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .	1
so much packed in a small case and very affordable ! .	1
if you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times , then this is a great camera choice .	1
and i can 't warn you enough to stay away from norton ! . ! .	0
the router has plenty of power for any type of bit or wood i need to cut , and the speed control knob is easy to get to .	1
i work on word , explorer , netscape , acrobat reader , photoshop at same time ( meaning using a lot of memory ) , but still dont see a problem with computer ( getting slow or crashing ) .	1
even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast .	0
exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments ( i leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure , which goes a bit dark for my taste ) .	1
small size .	1
i have transferred in about 2 , 400 tracks so far - very easy to use both the ipod and itunes .	1
a sony erickson may be the phone for you . . . but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price .	1
i think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good .	1
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .	1
- uploading music is quick and easy .	1
after several years of torture in the hands of at & t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at & t to t-mobile ! .	0
it seemed as if we were emoting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless .	0
this is a benefit for many reasons ; . one being just for appearance , your pants wo n 't be bulging with this phone in your pocket .	1
the included software removes any red eye easily .	1
the touch sarene navigation will take a little getting used to , but once you do , and while the zen is still alive , it 's a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies .	0
i would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something , but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router , just get the wrt54g .	1
now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk .	0
i love this player .	1
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n 't blind you when you stare too long .	1
it also has a voice recorder and fm radio that you can only get on an ipod if you but an adapter seperately .	1
i finally got a free support number for norton through my usp support staff , but waited an hour or more for a voice .	0
i don 't know , maybe i got a defective one but first , the player would not shut off , next , the player would not come on - i had to send it away to get repaired .	0
upon opening the box i was confronted with this small cute little mp3 player .	1
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .	1
verdict : had i not needed something with a tad bit more space , i consider this player fair game .	0
but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .	0
if you experience problems with installation , you can visit symantec 's website , click the support tab , click the 'home or home office support ' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it .	0
it barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzes all over the player , because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart .	0
for one thing , the diapers always get jammed in it .	0
i am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the `` sliding wrench `` which comes on the router .	0
the base was deeper and the highs were crisper .	1
another thing you should know , the metal on the flip side of the ipod is very tacky , and scratches very easily .	0
first off , the battery .	0
they take excellent macro shots as well .	1
this is a fantastic tool to use .	1
however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .	1
i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .	1
i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down . now buy it ! .	1
anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception .	1
for more than a year , and it is totally reliable .	1
it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n 't the only one this happened to . )	0
it is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great .	1
the hard case they give with it must work well .	1
even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .	0
four megapixels is great .	1
bottom line is that at $ 160 , this is an absolute steal .	1
gets nice sound too .	1
the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .	0
it comes with a good case that fits it snugly .	1
i 've been using nis 2004 for about 2 months and it works well .	1
personally , i may never buy symantect products again .	0
4- looks great .	1
the phone is sturdy .	1
but if you use all bluetooth accessories , as i do , its really not an issue .	1
i have not yet used all the features , like the calendar , etc , but as a music player this little thing rocks .	1
i got it to use with the new $ 5-per-month service from yahoo ( music unlimited , ) and despite the above issues , i love it .	1
seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection .	0
the camera is solid , performs well , takes good pictures , and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the lcd viewfinder .	1
being a past norton customer , i consider this to be a slap to my face .	0
sound i 'm no audiophile but i was amazed by the clarity the player had , it was much better than the sound card on my computer and louder too .	1
i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; . this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57 , 000 mb of free memory available to me .	1
this is my first digital camera and i could n 't be happier .	1
my first impression was positive .	1
i really have no complaints over this unit .	1
my only complaint ( really more of an observation ) is that the outside finish of the ipod is rather delicate , so i am going to get a case for mine so it doesn 't get all scratched up .	0
all in all i am pleased with the router .	1
- replaceable battery .	1
overall , it does its basic function very well , but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the zen micro does not rise to the occasion .	0
after installation , which was very simple . . . . i downloaded any updated software from the creative website , before i downloaded any music .	1
2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )	1
the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; . you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! . ) .	0
and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .	0
all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukebox ed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .	1
it seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the micro to pull in a strong sound .	0
the look & feel : i have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambiance .	1
this new click wheel ipod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection .	1
the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .	1
this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price .	1
this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .	1
the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use .	0
the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .	1
3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .	0
even with the waterproof housing it is small .	1
it makes the nomad i purchase feel and look like junk .	1
the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .	0
2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it .	0
i think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature , and the zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality , with no need to upgrade the earphones .	1
knocked 1 star off for the install wizard - it wasted alot of time running it .	0
3 ) the champ is odor free for at least 15 months .	1
great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .	1
this product is too fragile for normal use .	0
within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob .	0
a decent camera phone for taking quick pictures , movies , and having general all around fun with .	1
getting the router setup in a `` vanilla `` configuration that works for 99 % of users was very easy , and i was able to do this no problem .	1
the battery does not last 12 hours .	0
bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent .	1
this camera is closest to perfect than any other diagram that is 4-5 megapixel .	1
i really liked the price . . .	1
i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .	1
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package .	1
i tried to play the song three times , with no success .	0
the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; . there are tons of features i have n 't even gotten to .	1
overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it .	1
you can use the ob ex file transfer service with bluetooth from linux ( kde-bluetooth provides a nice integration into conqueror for this ) for sending files to the phone .	1
it is the 'first generation ' of the player , and while i still agree that it is a great alternative to the ipod , i think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck .	0
lastly , the price is fantastic :	1
after getting used to the m12 all the rest seemed lacking .	1
goes ~3 days after a charge .	1
i have noticed an odor ( one the i expected ! . ) when unloading the diaper champ but at least you don 't smell anything every time you use it .	0
i bought the player this week and i like it by far .	1
software - music match jukebox is n 't the greatest , the search function is n 't fast even when accessing it with the hot key shortcut .	0
it also has unproven battery life .	0
if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .	1
norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from .	1
2 . it can be operated with one hand - leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table .	1
also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .	0
just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( almost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .	1
it works great .	1
when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .	1
recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .	1
however , the battery life is good enough you should n 't be overly concerned with turning this phone off .	1
i can 't tell you how many times i 've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it .	0
it gives you the most bang for your buck , period .	1
battery life is ok .	1
the size is tiny , which i love .	1
i was an early purchaser of the wrt54g , and had a few problems with stability and speed - finally , the march 03 firmware update has resulted in an excellent product ! .	1
i have about 6 gb used on my ipod so far ( well over 1000 songs ) , and as far as i can tell , all of them play at near-cd quality .	1
if you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged , they charge you roughly $ 105 . 50 per minute and blame you for `` abusing `` your ipod .	0
1 ) great audio quality overall .	1
the battery has a long life .	1
the depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the m12v than it was on my old router .	1
the lcd screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones .	0
to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; . however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .	0
unfortunately , i sold it exactly a month later .	0
another problem is that the latest 2 . 0 firmware upgrade moves you into windows media player 10 which seems to be very , very slow for downloads . charging [ -2 ]	0
by no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it , just be able to put a cd in the computer and it tells you what to do .	1
i have used norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years , the software has gotten more and more disgraceful .	0
so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out .	0
it 's not my first choice in cameras ,	0
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .	1
then , my ad/pop-up blocking was completely gone .	0
the new canon s300 is 33 % larger and 26 % heavier than the s100 .	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .	0
sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .	1
however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .	0
my only complaint and the reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren 't as intuitive as they should be .	0
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .	1
for last one month my rebate status showing me that my rebate is approved and check is delivered but still i am waiting for check .	0
bluetooth does not work on this phone .	0
if your looking for a great sounding mini player , you can 't go wrong with the zen micro .	1
the phones are awesome .	1
the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed .	0
after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift .	0
when you consider expandability ( downloads via computer ) , the numerous features , two transmission programs and multiple storage devices , dependability - this is a phone that isn 't easy to out-grow .	0
to use the creative zen player with a subscription service , you need to go to creative 's web site , and download new software for your pc .	0
the remote is a little hard to understand .	0
but since it 's so small , it isn 't a big deal to bring it with me .	1
the wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog .	1
this version of internet security 2004 , is beyond hope .	0
a huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it .	1
we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken .	1
high quality video and pictures rock ! .	1
the hitachi is made in malaya , and looked cheap compared with the makita , which is made in the usa .	1
	1
the instructions that come with it do n 't explain how to make things simple .	0
versatile and stylish .	1
) one outstanding positive feature is the battery . it holds a charge for a long time , longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup .	1
the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance .	0
i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it .	1
the af feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal .	1
the soft start is nice .	1
it has n't gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ) .	1
8 battery life is excellent .	1
although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .	1
the plunge action isn 't smooth unless you make it so .	0
for example , in auto mode you can 't use the flash redeye reduction , you must be in manual mode for that .	0
i am quite happy with the camera .	1
not only is it inconvenient , but also the battery life span is short .	0
the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .	1
i have had no problem either with backward compatibility , in that the `` mixed mode `` feature lets you both 54 and 11 mb cards off the router .	1
all the camera 's functionality is only available ( or selectable ) when the screen is functional .	0
also , the wma compression format is superior to mp3 , especially at lower bit rates , so i needed a player that could handle wma and integrate well with my windows xp computers .	1
and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey ! .	1
get it , it 's woth every penny ! . ! .	1
unfortunately , the touch-pad issues [ non-intuitive ] and poor instruction guide killed it .	0
slow-syncro flash , macro/infinity mode , etc .	1
the included earbuds were uncomfortable .	0
yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them .	0
i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptable period of time for something to work .	0
cuts are easy and smooth .	1
very simple and painless .	1
the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly .	0
reliability & build i dropped the player once from about 4 ft , and it fell hard , but kept on playing .	1
- excellent sound quality	1
this is only a problem at night , during the day the screen is very easy to see .	0
creative media source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it , and the file transfers are fast .	1
unit took forever since the beginning to recognize and play discs .	0
i would recommend this camera unequivocally ! .	1
as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .	0
the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did .	1
the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .	1
i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .	1
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver .	0
only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .	0
it sends discontinuous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .	0
the panorama modes are wonderful .	1
pertaining to the speed issue : i got 54mps while i was in the same room .	1
placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect .	1
1 ) frame freezes and the family yells , `` dad ! . somethings wrong with the dvd player ! . come quick ! . ``	0
this is a great product , and canon has done an excellent job .	1
no more banner ads , pop-ups , and the reliable antivirus .	1
i had some issues when i had enabled wep encryption and then moved on to wpa .	0
a great camera , but here are some points which i don 't notice in most of the reviews here , which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer :	1
comments : overall this is still a great value , but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market .	1
battery life is good for a phone of this size .	1
3 ) 4x zoom is nice	1
yes , i recommend it over the competition .	1
to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod .	1
putting in mp3 player , lots of games and application to download .	1
however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .	0
the player is smaller than you think .	1
although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .	0
the two-times optical zoom operates smoothly and quietly , and lo and behold , a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off .	1
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .	1
one cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem .	1
nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .	1
works great ! . ! . ! . ! .	1
we use the cheap $ 1 . 99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around .	1
it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc .	0
i think the interface is great .	1
this may be a really cool phone , but it 's not worth it with t-mobile .	1
i recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers .	1
the one and most major thing that i was disappointed with , in this player , is the battery life .	0
even though you could get a cheap router these days , i 'm happy i spent a little extra for the linksys .	1
otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; . shutter delay is n 't so bad either .	1
the transmission speed is also quite good , with pages loading very quickly .	1
minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable .	0
4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .	1
if you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained , than the diaper champ is the one for you ! .	1
from the internet , woodworking books , local stores and personal opinions the hitachi m12v 3-1/4 hp router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price .	1
cons - difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as i was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor .	0
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well re cored mp3s .	1
if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket , take great pics and video , get the sd500 .	1
i love this product ! .	1
the champ works great .	1
so far i have used all of the above-mentioned features , and find them well designed , and easy to understand .	1
well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .	0
the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .	0
the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc . other niceties , that you would enjoy .	1
also , the lens cap design is flawed .	0
yes , you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle , but then it is gone .	0
the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .	0
the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .	0
being a very economical person , i appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system- i never did like the prospect of buying special diaper genie refills .	1
it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up .	1
ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n 't even gotten to all of them yet .	1
i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it .	1
sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening ! .	1
the disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures , especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can .	0
this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my counter top and also to listen to my old 8-track records .	1
it comes with an adapter to plug into the wall , which i hear is a step up from the other ipods , which require you plug it into a computer to charge it .	1
the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n 't load on some computers .	0
not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .	1
overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .	1
2 ) the delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots .	0
it feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon .	1
once it froze so bad i couldn 't even use the power button to turn it off , and had to open and take out the battery .	0
very fast powerup and great speed when taking multiple pictures .	1
i finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with napster 2 go . . . . which is a subscription service , allowing me to download as much music as i want for a $ 14 . 95 flat fee .	1
2 ) not very ergonomically - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )	0
and so far , i have been very , very happy with my zen micro .	1
3 ) the joystick design they are using on the new nokias gives you a great degree of control .	1
most of the other players i checked dont have user serviceable battery .	1
i love this camera .	1
try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .	1
the plug er gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess .	0
these include : mp3 , wave , wma , wma pro , and wma loss less ; . it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file ( s ) to be converted .	1
it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera .	1
7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .	1
it really is a great buy if you are loo kin at having just one modem but many computers around the house .	1
overall , a good buy for the price .	1
first , it serious , serious installation problems .	0
-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .	0
this year , it seems that i choose my timing perfectly , having discovered the awesome device that is the zen micro .	1
i replaced it with a router raiser and it works much better .	0
another irrigation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on .	0
i have really enjoyed the camera on this phone .	1
overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .	1
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .	1
downloads are a snap and quick .	1
not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want .	1
i 've since replaced it with a pair of black sennheisers . . . not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable , but are too similar to ipod 's and can target ipod thieves here in nyc .	0
i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .	1
once you set it up , it 's great .	1
and amazon . com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ? .	1
my last simpler nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use .	0
to make matters work , there is no manual override to overcome this problem .	0
3 . bags are easy to change .	1
the fm radio 's reception isn 't spectacular , but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area .	0
if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .	1
it 's good .	1
excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .	1
its really cool .	1
we lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems .	1
i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed .	1
battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k . reeves .	1
it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .	1
the diaper champ couldn 't be easier to use .	1
this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .	1
the battery is removable .	1
while i 'm not too keen on their customer service ( none of the products i have from creative have given me issues ) , i can definitely recommend the zen micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more . . . without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth .	1
the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough .	1
the software could n 't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n 't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .	1
the ones i 've kept ( porter cables , dew alts , bosch , and this hitachi ) have proven their worth over the years , however , when i need a real workhorse , i grab this router .	1
if you 're looking for a 3hp plunge router , the hitachi m12v is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget .	1
this router has soft start and runs smooth and true .	1
i liked this one enough to buy another .	1
it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .	0
they 're easy to use .	1
- solid , high-quality construction	1
it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .	0
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .	1
for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison .	1
not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have .	1
8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .	1
on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd .	0
i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy .	1
it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .	1
5- excelent software package .	1
the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .	0
who in the hell needs a frigging *vga* camera on their cellphone ? . ? . ? .	0
silver metal case -not plastic .	1
it was also the most appealing .	1
great price .	1
i think it is a combination of the program size taking up resources and the open/close scanning that it does with every program .	0
in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .	1
the interface , while a bit confusing at first , is very easy to navigate after about 15 minutes .	1
i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response .	0
right now , the creative software transfers subscription music files very slowly .	0
first thing i noticed was that the creative wasn 't well made .	0
all of the wireless components that i bought were a breeze to set up as well .	1
as said before this works perfectly .	1
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen .	1
all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing creepiness of this very embarassing gift .	0
its quiet .	0
5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control .	0
zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod .	1
also , not liking the gel case .	0
i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .	0
the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .	0
i am a big fan of itunes , simply because it is terribly fast and convenient - if you are buying the songs from the itunes site .	1
- included creative software is pretty poor .	0
in short - nokia themselves don 't know that this phone doesn 't work with the palm , and if you don 't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts , chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly .	0
too bad they don 't mention anything about how the cd can 't be used with a mac .	0
canon 's g3 does it consistently .	0
because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos ! .	1
picture and video quality is ok .	1
i must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held .	1
best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .	1
smooth plunging mechanism .	1
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .	1
the creative mediasource software that comes with the zen micro is cluttered , and excludes my favorite feature in itunes , the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder .	0
speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .	1
no need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require ! .	1
i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .	1
as far as linksys goes , i have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well - no problems .	1
2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre , artist , album , etc . ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information .	0
the software you get with this camera is perfect .	1
the service from the supplier was exceptional .	1
first , the cons . . . a tad bulky . . . not the most aesthetic looking player . . . and does n 't support a folder structure .	0
the manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance ( but there is no manual focus or manual exposure ) .	1
i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n 't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) .	0
the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .	1
i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .	1
i have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before i drop money on a tool and everyone i talked to loved this router .	1
by focusing exclusively on quality rather than excessive marketing , they have introduced a player that can look the ipod straight in the eye and not flinch .	1
having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .	1
we are overall pleased with product .	1
since i use it in a table , i don 't use the plunge feature , but if i ever need it i 've got it .	1
mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs .	0
it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing ! .	1
so i took out the battery and put it back in again , only to find that it would not work .	0
and it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained , which the diaper genie never did ! .	1
but like i stated , its better then a trash can , but i 'm not sure if its better then the diaper genie .	1
but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in `` auto `` mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it ! .	1
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong .	1
the build quality feels solid , it does n 't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dots and dd5 . 1 sound good ) .	1
it 's as though nokia has segregated 90 % of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10 % for the day to day use .	0
lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .	1
c . i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer .	1
it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do .	0
it has one more resolution of 1024x768 and a `` normal `` compression mode . and , it has the 3x zoom .	1
usb 2 . 0 - very fast	1
my old sony ericsson t610 has this feature .	0
this is a good deal for music and data storage .	1
the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg , kodak pic 's and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and so om not so good , but my feeling at this time is `` two thumbs up `` ! .	1
